"@andrewmichaelio @naval Republicans are the centrist party that wants to restore freedom to the people, have a merit-based society, secure the border and put dangerous criminals in prison. 

This was the Democratic Party platform not that long ago."
"For anyone, whether in America or other countries, who finds this result shocking, they should reconsider where they get their information. 

This trend was obvious on 𝕏 for months, but almost all the legacy mainstream media pushed a completely false reality.

They lied to you."
"Arizona just declared for @realDonaldTrump, making it a clean sweep of all swing states!

Massive red wave success! It is beyond a landslide, as Republicans won:

– Presidency
– Popular vote
– Senate majority
– House majority
– State governor majority
– State legislature majority"
"Given the unequivocal mandate given to @realDonaldTrump from the people of America, winning not just the electoral college by a landslide, but also the popular vote, Senate AND House, there will be none of that nonsense this time. 

They won’t even try."

Out of nowhere several weeks ago, he said “Dad, we have to help Trump!”."
"@Rob_2628 @JoshuaDReynolds 😂

That’s because too many people in Germany believe the legacy media.

Huge thank you to everyone who supported this platform and our mutual quest to support freedom of speech!
"The reality of this election was plain to see on 𝕏, while most legacy media lied relentlessly to the public.

"@cb_doge That was priority #1. 

Democrat vs Republican early voting in Pennsylvania was better for Dems than 2020 until just after 10/10.

Then a series of things happened that dramatically changed the picture to where Dems are now ~600k votes worse than 2020 going into election day. https://t.co/hxTD0p1NMW"
The legacy media hope that a hoax a day keeps DJT away. It won’t work.
"Below are the R minus D early vote deltas in swing states before tomorrow. 

Republican turnout on election day is usually much higher than Democrat, so any state currently leaning R in early voting is very likely to side with Trump.

"💯

Those are their stated goals!

Unless @realDonaldTrump wins, this will be the last election. 

The Dems will legalize all the illegals in swing states, so there be no more swing states. America will become a one-party, deep blue socialist state."
"@DefiyantlyFree Correct. 

As of yesterday’s data, D vs R early votes are 602k worse for D than 2020 when Biden only had an 80k margin of victory. 

That is almost 10% of the probable electorate (6.9M voted in 2020)!

Unless something very strange happens, Ds will have a blowout loss in PA."
